        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of curcumin (E 100). Curcumin has been previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). In 2004 JECFA allocated an ADI of 0–3 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and based its evaluation on previous evaluations, additional literature that became available since then and the data available following a public call for data. The Panel considered that the indications provided by the positive results for curcumin in several in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity, especially those detecting chromosomal aberrations and DNA adducts should not be disregarded, and that the available in vivo genotoxicity studies were insufficient to eliminate the concerns regarding genotoxicity. The Panel noted that all statistically significant effects noted by NTP in a long-term carcinogenicity study in rats and mice refer to benign neoplastic lesions (adenomas) and that the incidences for malignant neoplastic lesions (carcinomas) did not reach statistical significance. The Panel also noted that the effects observed were not dose-dependent, were in line with historical control values and not consistent across sexes and/or species. The Panel agreed with JECFA that curcumin is not carcinogenic. The Panel also concluded that this eliminates the concerns over genotoxicity. The Panel concluded that the present database supports an ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 250–320 mg/kg bw/day from the reproductive toxicity study for a decreased body weight gain in the F2 generation observed at the highest dose level, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Panel concluded that at the maximum levels of use, intake estimates for 1- to 10-year old children at the mean and the high percentile (95th) are above the ADI in some European countries. The Panel noted that intake of curcumin from the normal diet amounts to less than 7% of the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day.",

Tartrazine has been previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1966 and the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1975 and 1984. Both committees established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0-7.5 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and based its evaluation on previous evaluations, additional literature that became available since then and the data available following a public call for data. New studies included a study by Sasaki et al. from 2002 reporting effects on nuclear DNA migration in the mouse in vivo Comet assay, a study by McCann et al. from 2007 that concluded that exposure to a mixture including Tartrazine resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3-year old and 8- to 9-year old children and studies on neurodevelopment by Tanaka. The Panel notes that Tartrazine was negative in long-term carcinogenicity studies and that the effects on nuclear DNA migration observed in the mouse in vivo Comet assay are not expected to result in carcinogenicity. The Panel also concurrs with the conclusion from a previous EFSA opinion on the McCann et al. study that the findings of the study cannot be used as a basis for altering the ADI, and additionally considered that the Tanaka study can also not be used as a basis for altering the ADI. The Panel concludes that the present database does not give reason to revise the ADI of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel also concludes that at the maximum reported levels of use, refined intake estimates are below the ADI. The Panel concludes that Tartrazine appears to be able to elicit intolerance reactions in a small fraction of the exposed population.The Panel also notes that sensitive individuals may react to Tartrazine at dose levels within the ADI.",

Quinoline Yellow has been previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1975, 1978 and 1984, and the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1984. Both committees established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0-10 mg/kg body weight (bw). Studies not evaluated by JECFA and the SCF included a chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study with a reproductive toxicity phase in rats and a study on behaviour in children by McCann et al. from 2007. The latter study concluded that exposure to a mixture of colours including Quinoline Yellow resulted in increased hyperactivity in 8- to 9-years old children. The Panel concurs with the conclusion from a previous EFSA opinion on the McCann et al. study that the findings of the study cannot be used as a basis for altering the ADI. The Panel notes that Quinoline Yellow was negative in in vitro genotoxicity as well as in long term carcinogenicity studies. The Panel concludes that the currently available database on semi-chronic, reproductive, developmental and long-term toxicity of Quinoline Yellow, including a study in rats not apparently taken into consideration by JECFA or the SCF, provides a rationale for re-definition of the ADI. Using the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day provided by the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study with a reproductive toxicity phase carried out in rats and applying an uncertainty factor of 100 to this NOAEL, the Panel establishes an ADI of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel notes that at the maximum levels of use of Quinoline Yellow, refined intake estimates are generally well over the ADI of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day.",

Following a request by the European Commission, the ANS Panel was asked to assess newly submitted data from a study conducted as a result of the recommendations contained in the 2009 opinion. In addition, EFSA was requested to carry out the refined exposure assessment of Sunset Yellow FCF. The new information assessed comprised an evaluation of the 28-day study report, the data considered by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in its latest evaluation from 2011, and any additional toxicological information that had become available since the completion of the previous evaluation by the ANS Panel. The ANS Panel has considered that the newly submitted data from the 28-day study and the overall available toxicological database on Sunset Yellow FCF provides a basis to revise the established temporary ADI and concluded that, based on the NOAEL of 375 mg/kg bw/day from the long-term feeding study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100, a new ADI for Sunset Yellow FCF of 4 mg/kg bw/day can be established, in agreement with the latest evaluation by JECFA. Exposure estimates for Sunset Yellow FCF based both on the currently authorised MPLs and reported use levels provided are well below the new ADI of 4 mg/kg bw/day for all population groups. Overall, the Panel concluded that, using data provided by the food industry and Member States, the reported uses and use levels of Sunset Yellow FCF (E 110) would not be of safety concern.",

        "abstract": "Cochineal, carminic acid, carmines (E 120) have been previously evaluated by JECFA and by the SCF. Both committees established an ADI of 5 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel noted that the title of the EC specifications for E 120 does not adequately correspond to the specified food additive and therefore, proposes to modify it to “E 120 cochineal extract, carminic acid and carmines”, which would more accurately reflect the material used. The Panel also noted that the specifications need to be updated with regard to the maximum limits for certain toxic elements present as impurities, to ensure that E 120 will not be a significant source of exposure to these toxic elements in food. No ADME studies on cochineal extract, carminic acid or carmines were available for evaluation, but indirect evidence suggests that carmines are absorbed and distributed in the body. Acute, short-term, subchronic, carcinogenicity, reproduction and developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats or mice did not show toxicological potential. Consideration of the available information regarding genotoxicity indicated that carminic acid is not genotoxic. The Panel concluded that the present dataset does not give reason to revise the ADI of 5 mg carmine (containing approximately 50 % carminic acid)/kg bw, allocated by the SCF in 1983. The Panel concluded that this ADI should be expressed as carminic acid content, which would correspond to 2.5 mg carminic acid/kg bw/day. The Panel considered that, since no threshold dose can be established for allergic reactions, it is advisable that exposure to the eliciting allergens, such as proteinaceous compounds, in E 120 is avoided by introducing appropriate purification steps in the manufacturing process. Refined exposure estimates show that exposure to E 120 for the non-brand-loyal scenario, is below the ADI of 2.5 mg carminic acid/kg bw/day for all population groups.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver an opinion to amend the specifications regarding the ‘definition’ and the ‘particle size’ limits of basic methacrylate copolymer (BMC – E 1205) listed in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012. The request resulted from the change of the manufacturing process from a bulk polymerisation process to a solution polymerisation process and that the specifications for the particle size of < 0.1 μm are set at limits of ‘between 5.1% and 5.5%’. These limits were never met and could be interpreted as requesting a defined percentage of nanoparticles in the powder. The specifications were amended as follows: at least 95% of the particles have a size below 50 μm; at least 50% have a size below 20 μm; not more than 10% have a size below 3 μm. Particles with a diameter of 0.1 μm (100 nm) or below were never observed in the batches analysed. A detailed description of the solution polymerisation process was provided together with data on residual solvents, residual monomers, stability and reaction and fate in food. No new or additional biological and toxicological data were submitted. The ANS Panel taking into account the available information and as BMC was recently evaluated by EFSA (EFSA ANS Panel, 2010), considered this conclusion would still be valid for BMC produced by the new manufacturing procedure and that the request for amending the specification can be accepted. Therefore, the Panel concluded that there is no safety concern from the proposed amendments in the specifications resulting from the changes in the manufacturing process for the food additive BMC.",

New studies included a study reporting alterations in the morphology of somatic chromosomes in Secale cereale (rye), and a study by McCann et al. that concluded that exposure to mixtures including Azorubine/Carmoisine, resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3-years old and 8- to 9-years old children. The Panel notes that the study in rye was not a standard genotoxicity assay, and concluded, given that all other genotoxicity tests were negative and that Azorubine/Carmoisine does not contain a structural alert, that there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity. The Panel also concurs with the conclusion from a previous EFSA opinion on the McCann et al. study that the findings of the study cannot be used as a basis for altering the ADI. The Panel concludes that the present database does not give reason to revise the ADI of 4 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel also concludes that at the maximum reported levels of use, refined intake estimates are below the ADI, although in 1- to 10-year old children the high percentile of exposure (95th) can be slightly higher than the ADI at the upper end of the range.",

Amaranth has been previously evaluated by JECFA in 1972, 1975, 1978 and 1984, and the SCF in 1976, 1979 and 1983. In 1984 the SCF set an ADI for Amaranth of 0-0.8 mg/kg bw/day based on results from a 90-day rat study. In contrast, in 1984 JECFA allocated an ADI of 0-0.5 mg/kg bw/day Amaranth based on a long-term carcinogenicity study in rats. In evaluating the overall toxicological database on Amaranth, the Panel concludes that the point of departure for establishing an ADI for Amaranth can be defined as 15 mg/kg bw/day, taking both the results from the 2-year study and the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies into account. Therefore using an uncertainty factor of 100, the Panel establishes an ADI for Amaranth of 0.15 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel concludes that at the maximum permitted level of use and/or reported use levels of Amaranth (Tier 2), estimates of anticipated exposure for children (1-14 years old) are around 30 times lower than the ADI of 0.15 mg/kg bw/day at the high percentiles (95th/97.5th). However, for adults the anticipated exposure to Amaranth at the 97.5th percentile can be up to 6 times higher than the ADI. The Panel also notes that main contributors to total anticipated exposure to Amaranth for adults were from aperitif wine drinks and Americano. The Panel notes that anticipated exposure to these uses have been made with the maximum permitted levels of use for Americano although no usage value for this beverage was provided by industry, and with the maximum reported levels of use for aperitif wine drinks, which were reported by Industry to be at the same level as the maximum permitted level.",

        "abstract": "The Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food has re-evaluated the safety of Erythrosine (E 127) when used as a food colouring substance. Erythrosine (E 127) is a xanthene-dye which has been previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1990 and the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1989. Both committees have established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0-0.1 mg/kg bw/day. Erythrosine is exclusively authorised for use in cocktail and candied cherries, and Bigarreaux cherries (94/36/EC). The Panel considered the weight-of-evidence still showed that the tumorigenic effects of Erythrosine in the thyroid gland of rats are secondary to its effects on thyroid function and not related to any genotoxic activity. Erythrosine-induced rodent thyroid tumours may be considered of limited relevance to humans; an approach which is consistent with previous evaluation of Erythrosine. The Panel considered Erythrosine has a minimal effect in humans at a clinical oral dose of 200 mg daily over 14 days, while a dose of 60 mg daily was without effect (Gardner et al., 1987). The current ADI adopted by the JECFA and the SCF is based on this study. The Panel concurred with their identification of this as the critical study. The 60 mg dose was taken to be the equivalent of 1 mg/kg bw/day. By applying a safety factor of 10 to allow for the small number of subjects used in the study and its relatively short duration, an ADI of 0-0.1 mg/kg bw per day was derived. The Panel concludes that the present database does not provide a basis to revise the ADI of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel concluded that at the current levels of use intake estimates for adults on average is 0.0031 mg/kg bw/day and 0.01 mg/kg bw/day at the 95th percentile, and consequently are below the ADI of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel considered there would be no safety concerns at current levels of exposure including other sources of exposure.",

In 2009, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of Allura Red AC (E 129) used as a food additive. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that, at the high level, under both scenarios, that is using either the maximum permitted levels (MPLs) or the reported use levels provided by industry, intake estimates for 1- to 10-year old children can be above the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Following this conclusion, EFSA performed a refined exposure assessment for this food colour, using new usage data from industry, as well as analytical data submitted to EFSA by Member States and the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. Usage data from industry were provided to EFSA for six out of the 51 food categories in which Allura Red AC (E 129) is authorised as a food additive; while analytical data from Member States were provided to EFSA for 35 food categories. Using MPLs and these new data, none of the exposure estimates exceeded the ADI of 7 mg/kg bw per day in any population.",

The Panel observed that Indigo Carmine was poorly absorbed and does not raise concern for genotoxicity. No adverse effects in subacute, chronic, reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, and no modifications of haematological and biological parameters in chronic toxicity studies have been identified at doses less than or equal to 500 mg/kg bw/day. The only report of an adverse effect was in testis with a LOAEL of 17 mg/kg bw/day which would give rise to a safety concern if confirmed. The Panel considered that this study has shortcomings since it is not clear to the Panel whether the adverse effects observed were due to the food additive itself or to impurities and/or contaminants present in the material tested and/or to the conduct of the study. The Panel considered that the current ADI of 5 mg/kg bw/day for Indigo Carmine was applicable to a material with the same purity and manufacturing process as material used in studies without adverse effects on testis (93% pure colouring and 7% volatile matter) and concluded that any extension of this ADI to Indigo Carmine of lower purity and/or manufactured using a different process would require new data which would need to address the adverse effects on testis. The Panel noted that at the MPL, exposure estimates of Indigo Carmine would exceed the ADI for toddlers and children at the high level. Exposure estimates using the available usage and analytical data did not show an exceedance of the ADI for any population groups.",

Neither of the Committees established a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Specifications should be updated to adequately cover chlorophylls (E 140(i)), as currently up to 90 % of the extract is unidentified and chlorophylls (E 140(i)) may be obtained from sources that could not be regarded as regular edible plant materials or foods (grass, lucerne, nettle) for humans. Based on the origin of chlorophylls (E 140(i)), the Panel also concluded that data on pesticides, mycotoxins and other components with biological activity (e.g. phytoestrogens, phytotoxins and allergens) should be included in the specification and kept as low as possible to avoid any potential adverse effects (allergenicity, endocrinal effects). The few biological data available indicate that chlorophylls are poorly absorbed by humans and are not metabolised to chlorophyllins (the dephytylated form of chlorophylls). The Panel considered that the few toxicological studies available for chlorophylls were limited and did not comply with the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines or current regulatory requirements, and therefore did not allow for an ADI to be established. The Panel concluded that the available database for chlorophylls was inadequate for risk assessment. However, chlorophylls are natural dietary constituents, which are present at relatively high concentrations in a number of foods. In addition, the exposure resulting from the use of chlorophylls (E 140(i)) as food additives is lower than the exposure to chlorophylls from the regular diet. Therefore, the Panel concluded that, at the reported use levels, chlorophylls (E 140(i)) are not of safety concern as regards their current use as food additives.",

Neither of the Committees established a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Specifications should be updated to adequately cover chlorophylls (E 140(i)), as currently up to 90 % of the extract is unidentified and chlorophylls (E 140(i)) may be obtained from sources that could not be regarded as regular edible plant materials or foods (grass, lucerne, nettle) for humans. Based on the origin of chlorophylls (E 140(i)), the Panel also concluded that data on pesticides, mycotoxins and other components with biological activity (e.g. phytoestrogens, phytotoxins and allergens) should be included in the specification and kept as low as possible to avoid any potential adverse effects (allergenicity, endocrinal effects). The few biological data available indicate that chlorophylls are poorly absorbed by humans and are not metabolised to chlorophyllins (the dephytylated form of chlorophylls). The Panel considered that the few toxicological studies available for chlorophylls were limited and did not comply with the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines or current regulatory requirements, and therefore did not allow for an ADI to be established. The Panel concluded that the available database for chlorophylls was inadequate for risk assessment. However, chlorophylls are natural dietary constituents, which are present at relatively high concentrations in a number of foods. In addition, the exposure resulting from the use of chlorophylls (E 140(i)) as food additives is lower than the exposure to chlorophylls from the regular diet.

The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (E 150a, E 150b, E 150c, E 150d) used as food additives in 2011. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for caramel colours E 150a, E 150c and E 150d, but exposure estimates to E 150b were below the ADI. Following this conclusion, new data from industry were submitted to EFSA providing updated use levels of caramel colours in foods ready to be consumed. A refined exposure assessment was performed for caramel colours that were exceeding the ADI in ANS Panel opinion (EFSA, 2011a) i.e. E 150a, E 150c and E 150d and concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure are considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment. However, toddlers and adults have a higher exposure to caramel colour E 150c and could still exceed the ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for this caramel colour. The estimated combined exposure to the four caramel colours (E 150a, E 150b, E 150c, E 150d) are considerably lower and the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day is not exceeded for any population group in the current review.",

        "abstract": "The ANS Panel provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of the caramel colours (E150a (Class I), E150b (Class II), E150c (Class III), E150d (Class IV)) used as food additives. The caramel colours are a complex mixture of compounds produced by heating carbohydrates under controlled heat and chemical processing conditions; they are divided into four classes according to the manufacturing reactants used. The caramel colours were previously evaluated by the SCF and by JECFA, which concluded that a numerical ADI was not necessary for Class I, but established ADIs for the other classes of caramels, ranging from160-200 mg/kg bw/day. Given the consistency in the toxicological database, the Panel establishes a group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day for the caramel colours, by applying an uncertainty factor of 100 to a NOAEL of 30 g/kg bw/day (highest dose tested) identified in 13-week rat studies with Class IV and a similar NOAEL identified in a rat reproductive toxicity study, also with Class IV. Comparable NOAELS for Classes II, III and IV were reported in the SCF and JECFA evaluations. Within this group ADI, the Panel establishes an individual ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for Class III due to new information regarding the immunotoxicity of THI. The Panel concludes that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the ADIs for Classes I, III and IV caramels, but exposure estimates to Class II were below the ADI. Exposure estimates for the caramel constituents THI, 4-MEI and SO2 are not of concern, but the Panel welcomes additional studies to clarify remaining uncertainties regarding effects of THI on the immune system. The Panel notes that other constituents of caramel colours including 5-HMF and furan may be present at levels that may be of concern, and considers that the specifications should include maximum levels for these constituents.",

        "abstract": "The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an exposure assessment of Brilliant Black BN (E 151), taking into account new information on its use as a food additive in foods. In 2010, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of Brilliant Black BN and concluded that dietary exposure in 1- to 10-year-old children at the high level may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for Brilliant Black BN of 5 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day at the upper end of the range. Following this conclusion, the European Commission requested that EFSA performs a refined exposure assessment for this food colour. Data on the presence of Brilliant Black BN in foods were requested from relevant stakeholders through a call for usage and concentration data. Usage levels were provided to EFSA for 11 out of 37 food categories in which Brilliant Black is authorised. In addition, 4 337 analytical results were also reported to EFSA, with the majority of values being below the limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification (LOQ). Exposure assessment was performed using the EFSA Comprehensive Food Consumption Database. Three scenarios were considered: (1) exposure estimates based on Maximum Permitted Levels (MPLs), (2) a refined brand-loyal exposure scenario, and (3) a refined non-brand-loyal exposure scenario. Considering the first scenario, high exposure levels (95th percentile) exceeded the ADI for toddlers and children in four dietary surveys. In comparison with the previous assessment, for both children and adults, the current mean exposure estimates are of the same order of magnitude, whereas the 95th percentile exposure is lower, particularly in adults. The mean and high-level exposure estimates of Brilliant Black BN are below the ADI for all population groups when considering the refined scenarios (brand-loyal and non-brand-loyal).",

        "abstract": "The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of propane-1,2-diol (E 1520) when used as a food additive. In 1996, the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for propane-1,2-diol. Propane-1,2-diol is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal and is expected to be widely distributed to organs and tissues. The major route of metabolism is oxidation to lactic acid and pyruvic acid. At high concentrations, free propane-1,2-diol is excreted in the urine. No treatment-related effects were observed in subchronic toxicity studies. The available data did not raise concern with respect to genotoxicity. Haematological changes suggestive of an increased red blood cell destruction with a compensatory increased rate of haematopoiesis were observed at the highest dose level (5,000 mg/kg bw per day) in a 2-year study in dogs. No adverse effects were reported in a 2-year chronic study in rats with propane-1,2-diol (up to 2,500 mg/kg bw per day). The SCF used this study to derive the ADI. No adverse effects were observed in the available reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. Propane-1,2-diol (E 1520) is authorised according to Annex III in some food additives, food flavourings, enzymes and nutrients and it is then carried over to the final food. Dietary exposure to E 1520 was assessed based on the use levels and analytical data. The Panel considered that for the food categories for which information was available, the exposure was likely to be overestimated. Considering the toxicity database, the Panel concluded that there was no reason to revise the current ADI of 25 mg/kg bw per day. The Panel also concluded that the mean and the high exposure levels (P95) of the brand-loyal refined exposure scenario did not exceed the ADI in any of the population groups from the use of propane-1,2-diol (E 1520) at the reported use levels and analytical results.",

Polyethylene glycols were evaluated by several international bodies and the AFC Panel previously adopted scientific opinions on the safety polyethylene glycol (E 1521). In 2006, the Panel concluded that based on all the data, consumption of PEG through use as plasticisers in film-coating formulations for food supplement tablets and/or capsules at the intended use level are not of safety concern. In 2007, in another opinion of the AFC Panel related to d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) in use for food for particular nutritional purposes, the Panel noted that TPGS intakes would correspond to intake to PEG 1000 at levels equivalent to 3.3–8.5 mg/kg body wieght (bw) per day which are within the range of group acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) of the SCF (1997) and JECFA (1980). This assessment could only take into account the use of polyethylene glycol (E 1521) in food supplements and thus the food supplements consumers only scenario was performed. It resulted in exposure estimates of polyethylene glycol (E 1521) up to 3.5 mg/kg bw per day at the mean and up to 6.1 mg/kg bw per day at the high level. The current exposure assessment is based on the methodology used in the re-evaluation of food additives together with reported use levels received following a call for data in 2017. Considering the uncertainties of the exposure assessment, these estimates very likely overestimated the real exposure to polyethylene glycol (E 1521). The Panel also noted that the highest calculated exposure estimate falls within the range of the group ADI previously established by SCF (5 mg/kg bw per day for PEG 300–4000) and of the one set by JECFA (10 mg/kg bw per day for PEG 200–10000).",

Vegetable carbon has been evaluated previously by the SCF (1977, 1983) and by JECFA (1970, 1977, 1987). Neither Committee established an ADI for vegetable carbon, but the SCF concluded that vegetable carbon could be used in food. The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and based its evaluation on previous evaluations and additional literature. The Panel considered the available toxicological data too limited to establish an ADI for vegetable carbon. The Panel noted that data on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of carbon blacks of hydrocarbon origin has been related to the PAHs content of these substances. However, the Panel noted that the margins of exposure for benzo[a]pyrene exposure from vegetable carbon were considerably higher than those estimated from the dietary benzo[a]pyrene exposure.The Panel concluded that at the reported use levels vegetable carbon (E 153) containing less than 1.0 µg/kg of residual carcinogenic PAHs expressed as benzo[a]pyrene is not of safety concern. This was also based on the long history of safe use as a medicinal substance and the knowledge that vegetable carbon is an inert substance which is essentially not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. The Panel considered that it may be appropriate to introduce in the specifications for vegetable carbon a requirement for residual carcinogenic PAHs expressed as benzo[a]pyrene using a validated analytical method of appropriate sensitivity (e.g. LOD of 0.1 µg/kg). The estimated dietary exposure of European children to vegetable carbon ranged from 3 to 29.7 mg/kg bw/day at the mean, and from 15.3 to 79.1 mg/kg bw/day at the 95th/97.5th percentile.

Also, exposure in other scenarios based on different assumptions was always within the range of the typical dietary intake of β-carotene. The ANS Panel concluded that the proposed extension of use of synthetic β-carotene [E 160a(ii)] at the proposed level of 5 mg/L in the final diluted FSMP in young children aged 1–3 years would not be of safety concern.",

Given: (a) that read-across among the five bixin- and norbixin-based annatto extracts was feasible; (b) the availability of adequate 90-day toxicity studies with Annatto B, C, E and F; (c) the absence of concern for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity of Annatto B, C, F and G, whereas the mutagenicity of Annatto E is equivocal, the Panel concluded that the safety of the currently authorised solvent-extracted bixin and norbixin (E 160b(i)), alkali-extracted annatto (E 160b(ii)) and oil-extracted annatto (E 160b(iii)), with the specifications defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, could not be assessed due to the lack of data, both in terms of identification and toxicological studies; solvent-extracted bixin (Annatto B), solvent-extracted norbixin (Annatto C), alkali-processed, acid-precipitated norbixin (Annatto F) and alkali-processed, not acid-precipitated norbixin (Annatto G and its norbixin salts) should comply with the specifications as recommended by the Panel. The toxicological database is sufficient to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 6 mg bixin/kg body weight (bw) per day and an ADI of 0.3 mg norbixin/kg bw per day. Exposure estimates for bixin were below the ADI for all population groups and for all refined exposure scenarios, including for the extension of use. For norbixin, exceedance was observed for the extension of use at the 95th percentile for some population groups.",

Paprika extract (E 160c) is a natural dye allowed as a food additive in the EU. The bioavailability of capsanthin and capsorubin from paprika extract is very low. Toxicological data were limited to a 13-week oral toxicity and one chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study on a specified paprika extract (DN-933), representative of commercially produced paprika extracts used as food colour. Based on the new studies on the specified paprika extract (DN-933), compliant with good laboratory practice (GLP), which fulfil the requirements for genotoxicity assessment according to the EFSA guidelines on food additives, the Panel concluded that paprika extracts used as food colours do not raise a genotoxic concern. No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are available, but evaluated by read-across. The Panel concluded in the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study that for the dose levels tested, paprika extract (E 160c) was not carcinogenic. Based on the lack of genotoxic potential, the Panel considered that the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for histopathological changes from this study could be used for establishing an acceptable daily intake (ADI). On this basis, the Panel established an ADI of 24 mg/kg bw/day for paprika extract (E 160c). Based on the analytical data on paprika extract N1, which is reported to be comparable to the specified paprika extract used in these studies (DN-933), the total carotenoid content was 7.1%. Using this value, the Panel established an ADI of 1.7 mg carotenoids/kg bw/day for paprika extract (E 160c). Exposures to paprika extract (E 160c) for the refined exposure assessment scenarios were below the ADI established by the Panel.",

Lutein has been previously evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1975 and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2006. JECFA established a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0-2 mg/kg body weight (bw) for lutein from Tagetes erecta and zeaxanthin. The SCF could not establish an ADI, but concluded that xanthophylls prepared from natural foods by physical processes are acceptable for use in food. The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and based its evaluation on previous evaluations, additional literature that became available since then and the data available following a public call for data. New studies included a 90-day study in rats in which no adverse effects were reported up to dose levels of 400 mg/kg bw/day. However, the Panel noted that, compared to the standard regulatory studies, the study is too limited to identify a NOAEL for the safety evaluation of lutein. The Panel concluded, based on the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg bw/day (the highest dose level tested) in a 90-day rat study, the absence of developmental toxicity at dose levels up to 1000 mg/kg bw/day (the highest dose level tested), the fact that lutein is not genotoxic, the fact that in 90-day studies no effects on reproductive organs were observed, and the fact that lutein is a normal constituent of the diet, that an ADI can be derived. Given the absence of a multigeneration reproductive toxicity study and of chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies the Panel applies an uncertainty factor of 200 and establishes an ADI of 1 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel noted that this ADI refers to lutein derived from Tagetes erecta containing at least 80% carotenoids consisting of lutein and zeaxanthin (79 and 5% respectively). The Panel concluded that at the current levels of use Tier 3 intake estimates are above the ADI at the upper end of the range.",

Canthaxanthin was previously evaluated by JECFA in 1974, 1987, and 1995, and the SCF in 1983, 1987 and 1997. Both committees have established an ADI of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the formation of crystalline deposits in the retina, which was observed in monkeys and humans. A NOAEL of 0.25 mg/kg bw/day for scotopic b-wave changes (without impairment of vision) was reported in a human study and a BMDL05 of 12-20 mg/day, amounting to 0.20-0.33 mg/kg bw/day for a 60 kg person, were derived in a worst case BMD analysis of the data from a meta-analysis on the crystal incidence in human eyes with increasing daily doses of canthaxanthin.

        "abstract": "Beetroot red (E 162) is a natural colour containing a number of pigments, all belonging to the class known as betalains. The main colouring principle consists of a number of betacyanins. The Panel noted that the specification for the content of red colour (expressed as betanin) in beetroot red, as not less than 0.4%, may give rise to some confusion, given the number of different forms of beetroot red that may be on the market, including simple extracts, refined extracts and spray-dried powders. The Panel considered that revision of the current specification to reflect betanin content on a dried solids basis could be appropriate. The Panel noted that toxicological studies carried out on material conforming to the specifications for beetroot red are limited in number. Acute and short-term toxicity studies are too limited to draw conclusions on these endpoints. The genotoxic potential of beetroot red could not be evaluated based on the available data. There are only limited or inadequate studies available on the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of beetroot red and therefore the Panel could not conclude on these endpoints. No adequate studies on reproduction and developmental toxicity were available. The Panel concluded that the currently available toxicological database was inadequate to establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for beetroot red as defined by the specifications set for the food additive E 162. However, the colouring principles in E 162 are natural dietary constituents having a long history of food consumption. In addition, the betanin exposure resulting from the use of beetroot red (E 162) as food additive is in the same range as the exposure to the betanin from the regular diet. Therefore, the Panel concluded that, at the reported use levels, beetroot red (E 162) is not of safety concern as regards its current use as a food additive.",

        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of calcium carbonate (E 170). Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt authorised as a food additive in the EU, and is also included in the list of substances that may be added for specific nutritional purposes in foods for particular nutritional uses and in Directive 2002/46/EC relating to food supplements. Calcium carbonate was previously evaluated by JECFA in 1965, when the Committee established an ADI not limited. The SCF evaluated calcium carbonate in 1990 as part of a group of carbonates, when the Committee assigned a group ADI not specified. The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and based its evaluation on previous evaluations, additional literature that became available since then and the data available following a public call for data. The Panel noted that the available toxicological database on calcium carbonate is limited, but does not give rise to concern. The few effects seen in studies in humans and animals are associated with high calcium carbonate intakes, and are also seen with other calcium salts. The Panel agrees with the group ADI “not specified” assigned by the SCF to a group of carbonates including calcium carbonate, when considering the use of calcium carbonate as a food additive. The Panel notes that the estimated exposures to calcium from all sources, including the use of calcium carbonate as a food additive, taken together with intakes of calcium from supplements and from food fortification are below the UL of 2500 mg/day for calcium from all sources established by the SCF in 2003. The Panel concludes that trace levels of adventitious nanoscale material within macroscale calcium carbonate are not of toxicological concern.",

        "abstract": "The present Opinion deals with the re-evaluation of the safety of titanium dioxide (TiO2, E 171) when used as a food additive. From the available data on absorption, distribution and excretion, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food concluded that the absorption of orally administered TiO2 is extremely low and the low bioavailability of TiO2 appears to be independent of particle size. The Panel concluded that the use of TiO2 as a food additive does not raise a genotoxic concern. From a carcinogenicity study with TiO2 in mice and in rats, the Panel chose the lowest no observed adverse effects levels (NOAEL) which was 2,250 mg TiO2/kg body weight (bw) per day for males from the rat study, the highest dose tested in this species and sex. The Panel noted that possible adverse effects in the reproductive system were identified in some studies conducted with material which was either non-food-grade or inadequately characterised nanomaterial (i.e. not E 171). There were no such indications in the available, albeit limited, database on reproductive endpoints for the food additive (E 171). The Panel was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on this endpoint due to the lack of an extended 90-day study or a multigeneration or extended-one generation reproduction toxicity study with the food additive (E 171). Therefore, the Panel did not establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI). The Panel considered that, on the database currently available and the considerations on the absorption of TiO2, the margins of safety (MoS) calculated from the NOAEL of 2,250 mg TiO2/kg bw per day identified in the toxicological data available and exposure data obtained from the reported use/analytical levels of TiO2 (E 171) would not be of concern. The Panel concluded that once definitive and reliable data on the reproductive toxicity of E 171 were available, the full dataset would enable the Panel to establish a health-based guidance value (ADI).",

The Panel noted that there are data gaps and concerns to be addressed to conduct a risk assessment with respect to the use of silver (E 174): lack of data on toxicity studies on elemental silver or the food additive (E 174); unknown particle size distribution of the food additive (E 174); evidence of the release of silver ions from elemental silver, which may be of concern. However, the extent of the release of the silver ions is unknown in the case of silver (E 174). The Panel concluded that the information available was insufficient to assess the safety of silver as food additive. The major issues included chemical identification an d characterisation of silver E 174 (e.g. quantity of nanoparticles and release of ionic silver) and similar information on the material used in the available toxicity studies. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the relevance of the available toxicological studies to the safety evaluation of silver as a food additive E 174 could not be established. The Panel recommended that the specifications for E 174 should include the mean particle size and particle size distribution (± SD), as well as the percentage (in number) of particles in the nanoscale (with at least one dimension below 100 nm), present in the powder form of silver (E 174) used as a food additive.

Gold (E 175) was previously evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1975. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has not reviewed gold due to lack of data. None of the Committees established an acceptable daily intake (ADI). The Panel noted the limited data on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of elemental gold and the absence of toxicological data on gold used as a food additive (E 175) and considered the data to be too limited to perform a risk assessment for E 175. Elemental gold has a very low solubility and thus the systemic availability and effects are expected to be low. In contact with tissues ionic gold can be released from elemental gold and a high local concentration of gold can be reached at the site of contact. The Panel noted that no data on subchronic, chronic toxicity and genotoxicity of elemental gold were available. The Panel concluded that, despite the absence of toxicity data, but taking into account the low solubility of elemental gold, systemic availability and thus systemic effects of elemental gold would not be expected. The Panel recommended that the specifications for gold (E 175) should include the mean particle size and particle size distribution (± SD), as well as the percentage (in number) of particles in the nanoscale (with at least one dimension below 100 nm), present in the powder form of gold (E 175).

JECFA was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), whereas the SCF established an ADI of 0-1.5 mg/kg bw/day.

Overall, the Panel considers that the present database is too limited to continue supporting the ADI for Litholrubine BK set previously by the SCF or to establish a new ADI. The Panel was unable to identify a suitable NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD to establish an ADI from a combined repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity study with Litholrubine BK in rats; males were exposed for 42 days and females exposed for 17 days, in accordance with OECD Test Guideline 422 and GLP conditions. The Panel thus concludes that the existing SCF ADI of 0-1.5 mg/kg bw/day should be withdrawn.

        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of Litholrubine BK (E 180). Litholrubine BK has been previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), with the latest evaluation in 1987 and by the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1983. JECFA was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), whereas the SCF established an ADI of 0-1.5 mg/kg bw/day. The Panel notes that SCF established the ADI of 0-1.5 mg/kg bw/day based on a reported NOAEL of 150 mg/kg bw/day identified in a long-term rat study. Overall, the Panel considers that the present database is too limited to continue supporting the ADI for Litholrubine BK set previously by the SCF or to establish a new ADI. The Panel was unable to identify a suitable NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD to establish an ADI from a combined repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity study with Litholrubine BK in rats; males were exposed for 42 days and females exposed for 17 days, in accordance with OECD Test Guideline 422 and GLP conditions. The Panel thus concludes that the existing SCF ADI of 0-1.5 mg/kg bw/day should be withdrawn. However, the Panel notes that the highest anticipated exposure to Litholrubine BK is 1700-fold lower than the identified effect level in female rats (100 mg/kg bw/day). Therefore, the Panel considers that it is unlikely there would be a significant safety concern for humans from the current single authorised use of Litholrubine BK in edible cheese rinds. No conclusion on the induction of hypersensitivity by Litholrubine BK could be drawn from the limited scientific evidence available, although after Litholrubine BK exposure from cosmetics, cheilitis has been documented in one case report.",

        "abstract": "The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion re-evaluating sorbic acid (E 200), potassium sorbate (E 202) and calcium sorbate (E 203) when used as food additives. Sorbic acid is absorbed and mainly excreted as expired carbon dioxide. The Panel noted that there was no evidence of genotoxic activity for sorbic acid or potassium sorbate. Sub-acute, sub-chronic and chronic toxicity studies did not show any adverse effects at concentrations up to 9 200 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day in rats. Given the lack of genotoxicity data on calcium sorbate and the available positive genotoxicity data on sodium sorbate, the Panel concluded that calcium sorbate should be excluded from the group ADI. The Panel concluded that the present dataset on reproductive and developmental toxicity gives a reason to revise the group ADI of 25 mg/kg bw/day set by the Scientific Committee on Food in 1996. The Panel considered that the no observed adverse effect level of 300 mg sorbic acid/kg bw/day from the two-generation reproductive toxicity study in rats can be used to allocate a temporary group ADI for sorbic acid and its potassium salt. By applying an uncertainty factor of 100, the Panel established a new temporary group ADI expressed as 3 mg sorbic acid/kg bw/day for sorbic acid and its potassium salt. The Panel noted that the most realistic approach using reported use levels and analytical data in the non-brand-loyal scenario did not exceed the temporary group ADI in any population group at the mean or in adolescents, adults and the elderly at the high level, except in the toddler and children population groups in one country.",

Benzoic acid and its sodium and potassium salts are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The Panel considered that the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of calcium benzoate will be similar to sodium or potassium salt and, therefore, read-across between the salts was possible. The results of short-term and subchronic studies on benzoic acid and its salts indicate that their toxicity is low. The Panel considered that the use of benzoic acid and its sodium and potassium salts as food additives does not raise a concern with respect to genotoxicity and, based on read-across, also considered that this conclusion is applicable for calcium benzoate. Moreover, the Panel noted that the available data did not indicate any carcinogenic potential. A four-generation reproductive toxicity study with benzoic acid in the diet in rats was considered by the Panel as the pivotal study and a no observed adverse effect level of 500 mg benzoic acid/kg body weight (bw) per day, the highest dose tested, was identified. From the aforementioned studies, the Panel derived an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg bw per day (expressed as benzoic acid) using an uncertainty factor of 100. Taking into account food categories for which direct addition of benzoic acid-benzoates is authorised, the group ADI was exceeded in the brand-loyal scenario in particular for toddlers and children consuming on a regular basis flavoured drinks. Considering additional exposure due to carry-over, the intake could be increased by up to two to three fold for all high-level consumers compared to the previous scenario with only direct addition to food. This results in exceedance of the group ADI in toddlers and children for the non-brand-loyal scenario.

Natamycin is a fungicide of the polyene macrolide group. According to Directive 95/2/EC, natamycin may be used for the surface treatment of semi-hard and semi-soft cheese and dry, cured sausage at a maximum level of 1 mg/dm2 in the outer 5 mm of the surface. The SCF in 1979 considered that the database was adequate to conclude that natamycin does not give rise to safety concern, but inadequate to establish an ADI. JECFA assigned an ADI of 0.3 mg/kg bw/day (1968, 1976, 2002). The Panel considered that the available data are not sufficiently robust for the purpose of deriving an ADI because of the limitations of the present database on natamycin (design of the animal studies, limited number of animals, lack of a carcinogenicity study) and in view of the inadequate description of the human data. The highest potential exposure to natamycin was below 0.1 mg/kg bw/day for children at the 97.5th percentile. Given that natamycin is very poorly absorbed, the Panel considers that this conservative estimate would provide an adequate margin of safety from the effect level seen from the long-term animal studies and the human study used by JECFA to establish an ADI. The Panel considered that the proposed use levels of natamycin are not of safety concern if it is only used for the surface treatment of the rind of semi-hard and semi-soft cheese and on the casings of certain sausages. The Panel concluded that there was no concern for the induction of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Hexamethylene tetramine (HMT) is a food additive, currently only permitted in EU for use in Provolone cheese. The maximum permitted level is 25 mg/kg residual amount, expressed as formaldehyde, the break down product of HMT under acidic conditions. HMT has been previously evaluated by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 1974) who established an ADI of 0.15 mg/kg bw/day based on a reproductive study with a NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day. Due to the limitations in the database the Panel could not identify a critical study and therefore to derive an ADI. However, the Panel noted that the exposure to formaldehyde from HMT of high level consumers of Provolone cheese equalled 18 µg formaldehyde/kg bw/day in adults and could be as high as 87 µg formaldehyde/kg bw/day in children according to a theoretical conservative assumption that all ripened cheese consumed was Provolone cheese. Considering the estimated exposure from the very limited permitted use, the toxicological database on HMT, the data from use of HMT therapeutically, the available oral toxicity and toxicokinetic data of formaldehyde and the magnitude of the potential effect on intracellular formaldehyde levels arising from this use of HMT, the Panel concluded that the use of HMT in Provolone cheese at the MPL of 25 mg/kg residual amount, expressed as formaldehyde, would not be of safety concern. However the Panel considered that any increase in the permitted uses of HMT or increases in the MPL of 25 mg /kg residual amount, expressed as formaldehyde would need detailed assessment which might require new toxicity data as well as use levels and/or an evaluation of its impact on formaldehyde levels in vivo.",

DMDC is authorised for the treatment of various beverages at a level of up to 250 mg/L. Once in solution, DMDC rapidly and fully hydrolysed (into carbon dioxide and methanol) and/or react with different constituents of beverages; the main identified reaction products are dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC) and methyl carbamate (MC). With no residue of DMDC remaining in the treated beverages ready for consumption, the risk resulting from DMDC use as a food additive was assessed by considering the exposure to methanol (a product of its hydrolysis) and to the main identified reaction products (DMC, MEC and MC). Taking into account several considerations (e.g. available toxicity database for the main identified reaction products, that the main identified reaction products belong to Cramer class I and the exposure to them remains below the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) with one exception for MEC for high-level consumers), the Panel concluded that it was not possible to derive an ADI from the available toxicological database, there is no indication for a safety concern from the use of DMDC (E 242) as a food additive at its currently reported uses and use levels and that a new assessment would be warranted in case of any change in the conditions of use.

The use of these food additives was evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and by the Scientific Committee on Food. Biological data on ascorbyl palmitate and stearate are sparse and the safety assessment of them for use as food additives is mainly based on the assumption that ascorbyl palmitate and ascorbyl stearate fully hydrolyse pre-systemically to ascorbic acid and their respective fatty acids. This was supported by an in vitro study reporting near-complete hydrolysis of ascorbyl palmitate in simulated intestinal fluid and by human data. The Panel considered that the toxicity of ascorbyl palmitate can be extrapolated from data describing the toxicity of ascorbic acid and palmitic acid and further considered that this assumption is also valid for ascorbyl stearate. The Panel concluded that the available toxicological data were too limited to establish an ADI for ascorbyl palmitate (E 304(i)) or ascorbyl stearate (E 304(ii)). Exposure estimates based on the high percentile for the maximum level exposure scenario range from 0.4 to 10.8 mg/kg bw/day across all population groups and from 0.3 to 9.9 mg/kg bw/day for the refined brand-loyal scenario.

        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of propyl gallate (E 310). Propyl gallate is an antioxidant authorised as a food additive in the EU. In 1976, the SCF established a group ADI of 0-0.2 mg/kg bw for three gallates (propyl, octyl, dodecyl). JECFA in its last evaluation in 1996 allocated an ADI only to propyl gallate of 0-1.4 mg/kg bw and did not establish ADIs for octyl and dodecyl gallate. The Panel considered that no substantial new toxicological data have emerged since this last evaluation. The Panel concluded that the 90-day toxicity study in rats was the key study for the evaluation of propyl gallate considering the uncertainties and lack of a NOAEL in the carcinogenicity database on propyl gallate. Based on the NOAEL of 135 mg propyl gallate/kg bw/day of this study and taking account of the Opinion of the Scientific Committee of EFSA on Default values, the Panel concluded that an uncertainty factor of 300 should be applied for extrapolation from a subchronic to chronic data and due to the limitations in the reproductive toxicity database and derived an ADI of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day for propyl gallate. The Panel also concluded that there was no longer a basis for the present group ADI and that propyl, octyl and dodecyl gallates should be evaluated separately and the present group ADI should be withdrawn. The high level of exposure exceeded the ADI in adults and the elderly. However, given the conservatism of the exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that the use of propyl gallate as food additive at the current uses and use levels is not of safety concern.",

The Panel considered that, whilst from theoretical considerations octyl gallate could be metabolised to octyl alcohol and gallic acid, there were insufficient data to demonstrate the rate and extent of octyl gallate metabolism in vivo. Having reviewed the data on the toxicokinetics (rate and extent of metabolism) of propyl, octyl and dodecyl gallate in a previous EFSA evaluation of propyl gallate, the Panel concluded that the available metabolism data on gallates were insufficient to provide a basis for the read-across of systemic toxicity data on propyl, octyl and dodecyl gallate to be valid. The Panel noted the absence of concern for genotoxicity and the lack of increase in the number of tumours in the long-term study. However, owing to the lack of detailed reports on carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity studies with octyl gallate and the absence of a basis for read-across for systemic toxicity from propyl gallate data, the Panel could not reach a definitive conclusion on the presence or absence of a carcinogenic potential of octyl gallate. The Panel identified a no observed adverse effect level of 50 mg/kg body weight per day in a reproductive toxicity study. Overall, the available database was too limited to either establish an acceptable daily intake or serve as a basis for a margin of safety approach to be applied with confidence. The Panel concluded that, although a safety concern was unlikely from the single use (chewing gum) for which usage and analytical data were provided, an adequate assessment of the safety of octyl gallate as a food additive in all its currently permitted uses would require a sufficient toxicological database in line with its current guidance for submission for food additive evaluations.",

        "abstract": "The current ANS Panel statement is a refined exposure assessment of tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ, E 319) when used as a food additive. TBHQ (E 319) is authorised as a food additive in the EU with an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.7 mg/kg body weight (bw), as established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1998 and confirmed by EFSA in 2004. In 2004, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) adopted an opinion on the safety in use of TBHQ (E 319) in fats and oils used for human consumption. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the exposure in adults did not exceed the ADI, however, if TBHQ (E 319) was to be used in infant formulae, the exposure in infants could exceed the ADI. Following this conclusion, EFSA performed a refined exposure assessment for TBHQ (E 319) based on individual food consumption data available within the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, on newly submitted data on the actual usage levels of TBHQ (E 319) and analytical data provided by the food industry and Member States. EFSA ANS Panel concluded that, using the maximum permitted levels, exposure estimates exceed the ADI of 0.7 mg/kg bw per day at the high level for toddlers and children, however, in the refined exposure scenarios, the ADI was not exceeded in any of the population groups.",

        "abstract": "The European Food Safety Authority have asked its Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food to prepare a revised exposure assessment to BHA (E 320) in order to apply a new exposure assessment methodology with the use of the EFSA Comprehensive Food Consumption Database and to take into account the exposure from the use in food contact materials. The exposure to BHA from its use as food additive using maximum permitted levels at mean level was in the range of 0.04-0.23 mg/kg bw/day for toddlers, 0.08-0.36 mg/kg bw/day for children, 0.06-0.18 mg/kg bw/day for adolescents, 0.03-0.12 mg/kg bw/day for adults and 0.02-0.11 mg/kg bw/day for the elderly. High level exposures at the 95th percentile was estimated in the range of 0.14-0.57 mg/kg bw/day for toddlers, 0.26-0.60 mg/kg bw/day for children, 0.12-0.38 mg/kg bw/day for adolescents, 0.08-1.12 mg/kg bw/day for adults, and 0.05-0.72 mg/kg bw/day for the elderly. Exposure to BHA from its use in food contact materials would be 0.43, 0.6, 1.3 and 2.5 mg/kg bw/day for adults and the elderly, adolescents, children and toddlers, respectively, assuming that consumers from all the population groups also consume 1 kg of food packed in plastics containing BHA at the maximum permitted quantity. The Panel concluded that exposure to BHA from its use as food additive based on new exposure estimates does not exceed the ADI of 1 mg/kg bw/day at the mean and generally does not exceed the ADI for adults at high level exposure (except for one country). The Panel also concluded that combined exposure to BHA from its use as food additive in foods and additive to food contact materials does exceed the ADI for most population groups on average and on high level consumption.",

        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) delivers an opinion re-evaluating the safety of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (E 321). BHT is an authorised synthetic antioxidant that was previously evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1996 and the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1987. The SCF established an ADI of 0-0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on thyroid, reproduction and haematological effects in the rat. JECFA allocated an ADI of 0-0.3 mg/kg bw/day for BHT based on effects in the reproduction segments and hepatic enzyme induction seen in two separate 2-generation studies in rats. The Panel concluded that BHT is not of concern with respect to genotoxicity and that any carcinogenicity would be thresholded. After the last SCF evaluation, two new 2-generation studies have been reported which were the basis for the ADI set by JECFA. Both studies revealed a NOAEL of 25 mg/kg bw/day. Overall, the Panel concluded that the present database gives reason to revise the ADI of 0.05 mg/kg bw/day. Based on the NOAEL of 25 mg/kg bw/day and an uncertainty factor of 100, the Panel derived an ADI of 0.25 mg/kg bw/day. Since the NOAEL of 25 mg/kg bw/day is below the BMDL10 value of 247 mg/kg bw/day derived from the data for the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in male rats, the Panel concluded that this NOAEL also covers the hepatocellular carcinomas observed in the long-term studies with BHT. Exposure of adults to BHT is unlikely to exceed the newly derived ADI at the mean and at the 95th percentile. For exposure of children to BHT from its use as food additive, the Panel noted that it is also unlikely that this ADI is exceeded at the mean, but is exceeded for some European countries (Finland, The Netherlands) at the 95th percentile.",

Depending on absorption capacity needed, pure cellulose or a mixture of cellulose and polyacrylic acid sodium salt crosslinked may be used as absorber. The Panel noted that if the active substances are used not in direct contact with food, but are placed in a pad under conditions where its absorption capacity is not exceeded, then no migration is to be expected and therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the mixture of the active substances citric acid (E330) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (E500ii), as carbon dioxide generator in liquid absorbent pads in the packaging of food such as fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, does not raise a safety concern. The absorbent pads should be used only under conditions in which the liquid absorption capacity is not exceeded and direct contact between the substance and the food is excluded.",

The Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data were available. Phosphates are authorised food additives in the EU in accordance with Annex II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. Exposure to phosphates from the whole diet was estimated using mainly analytical data. The values ranged from 251 mg P/person per day in infants to 1,625 mg P/person per day for adults, and the high exposure (95th percentile) from 331 mg P/person per day in infants to 2,728 mg P/person per day for adults. Phosphate is essential for all living organisms, is absorbed at 80–90% as free orthophosphate excreted via the kidney. The Panel considered phosphates to be of low acute oral toxicity and there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. No effects were reported in developmental toxicity studies. The Panel derived a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates expressed as phosphorus of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and concluded that this ADI is protective for the human population. The Panel noted that in the estimated exposure scenario based on analytical data exposure estimates exceeded the proposed ADI for infants, toddlers and other children at the mean level, and for infants, toddlers, children and adolescents at the 95th percentile. The Panel also noted that phosphates exposure by food supplements exceeds the proposed ADI. The Panel concluded that the available data did not give rise to safety concerns in infants below 16 weeks of age consuming formula and food for medical purposes.",

This was not covered by the previous re-evaluation of the safety of extracts of rosemary (E 392) as a food additive performed by EFSA in 2008. In that previous opinion, it was noted that, whilst the data were insufficient to establish a numerical ADI, the margin of safety was high enough to conclude that dietary exposure resulting from the proposed uses and use levels was not of safety concern. In providing a scientific opinion on the safety of the proposed extensions of use, the ANS Panel has decided that a comparison of the exposure resulting from the current uses and use levels with the exposure resulting from these additional proposed uses would be sufficient to address the safety of extracts of rosemary. The Panel concluded that, since the two additional uses for rosemary extracts in fat-based spreads would not change the estimated exposure to the food additive compared with the already approved permitted uses in any part of the population, the conclusions made by the AFC Panel in 2008 regarding safety remain valid. Therefore, the Panel considered that it is unlikely that there is a safety concern with the current permitted uses together with the additional proposed extension of uses compared with the current permitted uses alone. The Panel recommends that a refined exposure assessment is carried out to decrease the existing uncertainties arising from its conservative estimates based on current MPLs.",

Overall, taking into account the lack of adequate data to address these uncertainties, the Panel concluded that the existing group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for carrageenan (E 407) and processed Eucheuma seaweed (E 407a) of 75 mg/kg bw per day should be considered temporary, while the database should be improved within 5 years after publication of this opinion.",

Locust bean gum (E 410) is an authorised food additive in the EU. Locust bean gum (E 410) as specified in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is derived from the ground endosperm of the seeds of the strains of carob tree, Ceratonia siliqua (L.) Taub. (Family Leguminosae). An acceptable daily intake (ADI) ‘not specified’ was allocated by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1981. Although not evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF), it was accepted by the SCF in 1991 for use in weaning food, and in 1994, in infant formulae for special medical purposes. Locust bean gum is practically undigested, not absorbed intact, but significantly fermented by enteric bacteria in humans. No adverse effects were reported in 90-day toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents at the highest doses tested and there was no concern with respect to the genotoxicity and to reproductive and developmental toxicity of locust bean gum (E 410). The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for locust bean gum (E 410), and that there is no safety concern for the general population at the refined exposure assessment for its reported uses as a food additive. However, infants and young children consuming foods for special medical purposes may show a higher susceptibility to gastrointestinal effects of locust bean gum due to their underlying medical condition. The Panel concluded that the available data do not allow an adequate assessment of the safety of locust bean gum (E 410) in these foods for infants and young children.",

Based on the reported use levels, a refined exposure of up to 64 mg/kg bw per day in children for the general population, 38 mg/kg bw per day for children consumers only of food supplements at the high level exposure and 115 mg/kg bw per day for infants consuming foods for special medical purposes and special formulae (FSMPs), were estimated. Xanthan gum (E 415) is unlikely to be absorbed intact and is expected to be fermented by intestinal microbiota. No adverse effects were reported at the highest doses tested in chronic and carcinogenicity studies and there is no concern with respect to the genotoxicity. Repeated oral intake by adults of xanthan gum up to 214 mg/kg bw per day for ten days was well tolerated, but some individuals experienced abdominal discomfort, an undesirable but not adverse effect. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for xanthan gum (E 415), and that there is no safety concern for the general population at the refined exposure assessment of xanthan gum (E 415) as food additive.

Karaya gum (E 416) is an authorised food additive in the EU. Karaya gum (E 416) as specified in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is derived from the exudates from the stems and branches of strains of Sterculia urens Roxburgh and other species of Sterculia (family Sterculiaceae) or from Cochlospermum gossypium A.P. De Candolle or other species of Cochlospermum (family Bixaceae). An acceptable daily intake (ADI) ‘not specified’ was allocated by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), whereas the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) allocated an ADI of 12.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Karaya gum is practically undigested and not degraded by intestinal microflora and it is most probably not or only negligibly absorbed unchanged in humans. There is no concern with respect to the genotoxicity of karaya gum from Sterculia spp. Karaya gum (E 416) from Sterculia spp. did not induce toxic effects in animals at dose levels up to 1,250 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. Karaya gum from Sterculia spp. was well tolerated in humans at dose about 100 mg/kg bw per day for 4 weeks. The Panel concluded that there is no safety concern at the refined exposure assessment for the use of karaya gum as a food additive and that there is no need for a numerical ADI for karaya gum. The Panel further concluded that exposure to karaya gum by the use of this food additive should not exceed 7,000 mg/person per day in adults, the level at which some experienced abdominal discomfort.",

The Panel considered the long-term carcinogenicity study in rats with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) equivalent to 2 500 mg/kg bw/day – consistent with the NOAEL defined in subchronic studies – as the key study and allocated a group ADI of 25 mg/kg bw/day using an uncertainty factor of 100. The estimated exposure of toddlers at the highest level in non-brand loyal scenario remains very close to the ADI (24.5 mg/kg bw/day). The Panel is aware that for three food categories no reported uses have been obtained and that other dietary sources of exposure to polysorbates could not been considered in this opinion and therefore more data (usage and analytical data) are needed to decrease uncertainties in the refined exposure assessment scenario used.",

The Panel considered the long-term carcinogenicity study in rats with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) equivalent to 2 500 mg/kg bw/day – consistent with the NOAEL defined in subchronic studies – as the key study and allocated a group ADI of 25 mg/kg bw/day using an uncertainty factor of 100. The estimated exposure of toddlers at the highest level in non-brand loyal scenario remains very close to the ADI (24.5 mg/kg bw/day). The Panel is aware that for three food categories no reported uses have been obtained and that other dietary sources of exposure to polysorbates could not been considered in this opinion and therefore more data (usage and analytical data) are needed to decrease uncertainties in the refined exposure assessment scenario used.",

        "abstract": "The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB, E 444) as a food additive. The SCF allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day in 1994. JECFA established an ADI of 20 mg/kg bw per day in 1997. Both the JECFA and the SCF concluded that the hepatic effects observed in the dog have little relevance to the safety evaluation in humans. The Panel agreed with this conclusion. Oral absorption is approximately 70% in rats, about 50% in dogs and ≥ 88% in humans. The Panel concluded that SAIB does not raise concern for genotoxicity. No treatment-related effects have been observed on clinical signs, haematology and clinical chemistry in humans at a dose of 20 mg/kg bw per day for 14 days. The Panel identified a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 2,000 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested, from chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental studies in rats. Applying an uncertainty factor of 100, an ADI of 20 mg/kg bw per day for SAIB can be established. Overall, the Panel concluded that the present data set on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, genotoxicity, subchronic, developmental and long-term toxicity, and carcinogenicity give reason to revise the ADI of 10 mg/kg bw per day allocated by the SCF in 1994 to 20 mg/kg bw per day. Considering that the ADI is not exceeded in any population group, the Panel also concluded that the use of SAIB (E 444) as a food additive at the permitted or reported use and use levels would not be of safety concern.",

The Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data were available. Phosphates are authorised food additives in the EU in accordance with Annex II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. Exposure to phosphates from the whole diet was estimated using mainly analytical data. The values ranged from 251 mg P/person per day in infants to 1,625 mg P/person per day for adults, and the high exposure (95th percentile) from 331 mg P/person per day in infants to 2,728 mg P/person per day for adults. Phosphate is essential for all living organisms, is absorbed at 80–90% as free orthophosphate excreted via the kidney. The Panel considered phosphates to be of low acute oral toxicity and there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. No effects were reported in developmental toxicity studies. The Panel derived a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates expressed as phosphorus of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day and concluded that this ADI is protective for the human population. The Panel noted that in the estimated exposure scenario based on analytical data exposure estimates exceeded the proposed ADI for infants, toddlers and other children at the mean level, and for infants, toddlers, children and adolescents at the 95th percentile. The Panel also noted that phosphates exposure by food supplements exceeds the proposed ADI.

        "abstract": "The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of β-cyclodextrin (E 459) as a food additive. β-Cyclodextrin is a non-reducing cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven α-1,4-linked d-glucopyranosyl units. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day to β-cyclodextrin (E 459) in 1996. β-Cyclodextrin is poorly absorbed following oral administration in animals and humans. It is hydrolysed to maltose and glucose by the gut microflora and endogenous amylases in the colon; consequently, β-cyclodextrin levels in tissues and serum are low (< 1%). β-Cyclodextrin has a low acute oral toxicity. Short-term and subchronic toxicity studies were available in rats and dogs. In rats, the main reported effect was an adaptive enlargement of the caecum, resulting from consumption of poorly digestible carbohydrates. From a 6-month study in rats, a no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) of 600 mg/kg bw per day was identified and from a 52-week dogs study, the NOAEL was 466 and 476 mg/kg bw per day in males and females, respectively. The Panel considered that there was no indication for genotoxicity of β-cyclodextrin. From a chronic toxicity studies in rats, a NOAEL of 654 and 864 mg/kg bw per day in males and females, respectively, was identified. Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were available and no evidence for carcinogenicity was found. The Panel concluded that, based on the available toxicological database, there is no reason to revise the current ADI of 5 mg/kg bw per day for β-cyclodextrin. Based on the available reported use and use levels, the Panel also concluded that the ADI was exceeded in the refined brand-loyal scenario (considered the most relevant scenario) in all population groups except for infants at the mean and in all population groups at the 95th percentile.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion regarding the safety of an amendment to specifications for the food additive hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC, E 464). It is requested that the limit of the sum of the two isomers (1-chloro-2-propanol and 2-chloro-1-propanol) of propylene chlorohydrin (PCH) in HPMC be raised from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg, in order to align it with the limit defined by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives in 2011. The ANS Panel received a dossier from the applicant and subsequently requested additional data. The ANS Panel noted that not all information was made available and that exposure to PCH is likely to be underestimated, since data were provided only for a limited number of authorised uses and that other sources of PCH were not included. The Panel also noted that the available data, for both PCH isomers, were indicative of a genotoxic hazard and that the results available from preliminary studies were deemed insufficient to make any conclusion regarding developmental toxicity. In addition, because no carcinogenic effects were observed in relevant chronic/carcinogenicity studies at the same time, it was impossible to derive a lower benchmark dose level. A margin of exposure approach to impurities, as suggested by EFSA guidance in 2012, was also not possible. Moreover, when considering a threshold of toxicological concern approach to genotoxic effects, the Panel was unable to make any conclusion regarding the absence of risk. Finally, analytical data provided for a total of 12 different batches of HPMC showed that PCH levels were in compliance with current specifications. The Panel concluded that the data available are insufficient to support a change in specification from 0.1 to 1 mg PCH/kg HPMC.",

The Panel previously adopted scientific opinions on the safety of sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473). In the 2010 opinion, the Panel concluded that, based on the data available, the additional use of the sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) may lead to exposures in excess of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) and sucroglycerides (E 474) established by EFSA in 2004. In 2012, an update on the exposure assessment of sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) was delivered as new data were submitted to EFSA providing use levels of sucrose esters of fatty acids as a surface treatment for fresh fruits and the resulting residual levels in fruit. This assessment also resulted in exposure estimates of sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) exceeding the ADI, although considerably lower than those estimated in 2010. The current exposure assessment is based on the recent methodology used in the re-evaluation of food additives together with reported use levels received following a call for data in 2014. New consumption data were also available since then. The Panel noted that the current exposure estimates to sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) exceeded the ADI of 40 mg/kg bw per day for many population groups; especially toddlers and children and that assuming that sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) is not used in the 24 food categories where data was not provided, these estimates very likely overestimated the real exposure to sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473).",

SSL and CSL are used as emulsifiers and stabilizers. An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 20 mg/kg bw/day for SSL and CSL (either singly or in combination) was established in 1974 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) endorsed this ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day in 1978. The biological fate of CSL is comparable in rodent and non-rodent species. The acute oral toxicity in rats is low. Subacute and subchronic oral toxicity studies with SSL and CSL in rats and dogs revealed a NOAEL of 5 % in the diet. Neither SSL and CSL nor their breakdown products stearic and lactic acid raise concern for genotoxicity. The NOAEL in a one-year oral toxicity study with SSL in rats was 2214 mg/kg bw/day for males and 2641 mg/kg bw/day for females. No data on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity were available. However, no reproductive or carcinogenic effects are expected since the products of hydrolysis, stearic and lactic acid are constituents of natural food and part of endogenous metabolism in mammals. The Panel concluded that based on the NOAEL of 2200 mg/kg bw/day derived from the one-year toxicity study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100, an ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate (E 481) and calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate (E 482) either singly or in combination can be established. The estimated exposure to SSL and CSL occurs mainly via the consumption of flavoured fermented milk products including heat treated products, bread and rolls and fine bakery wares and is below the ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for all the adult population including the elderly, but exceeds the ADI for other groups of the population at mean level and for all groups of the population at high level.",

        "abstract": "The Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings added to Food (FAF) provided a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of chlorides (E 507–509, E 511) as food additives. Chlorides are authorised food additives in the EU in accordance with Annex II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. In the non- brand-loyal scenario, mean exposure to chlorides (E 507–509, E 511) as food additives ranged from 2 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day in the elderly to 42 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. The 95th percentile of exposure ranged from 5 mg/kg bw per day in the elderly to 71 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers. Chloride is an essential nutrient and after absorption is distributed to organs and tissues. The Panel considered chlorides to be of low acute oral toxicity and there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. No effects were reported in developmental toxicity studies in rats following administration of magnesium chloride hexahydrate at 800 mg/kg bw per day. Some animal studies suggested a role of chloride in increasing blood pressure but based on the toxicological database available the Panel considered human data more appropriate to identify a level of chloride intake which does not raise a safety concern. The Panel identified a human dose of 40 mg chloride/kg bw per day as a reference value for the assessment. Mean levels of exposure in all age groups were below or at this reference value, which indicates no safety concern. In some age groups (toddlers, children and adolescents), the 95th percentile exposure estimates were slightly above this reference value. The Panel concluded that the exposure to chloride from hydrochloric acid and its potassium, calcium and magnesium salts (E 507, E 508, E 509 and E 511) does not raise a safety concern at the reported use and use levels.",

The Panel was not provided with a newly submitted dossier and no new toxicological or biological information was submitted for the present re-evaluation following a public call for data and based its evaluation on previous evaluations and additional literature that became available since then. The Panel agreed with the SCF that the database did not allow the establishment of an ADI. The Panel considered nephropathy in mice as the most sensitive endpoint for 4-HR toxicity. The lowest BMDL10 for nephropathy in carcinogenicity study in mice (4 mg/kg bw/day) and the highest exposure estimate (3.3 µg/kg bw/day, adults, 95th percentile of consumers only) provided the MoS considered by the Panel as sufficient given the conservative nature of exposure estimates and limited uses. The Panel concluded that 4-HR was toxicologically acceptable for prevention of melanosis in shrimps and related crustaceans provided that residues in crustacean meat do not exceed 2 mg/kg. The Panel concluded that any increase in the permitted use would require additional reproductive toxicity studies. As the information on actual residual levels in crustaceans was limited the Panel recommended monitoring of these levels in the European market.",

        "abstract": "The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of glutamic acid–glutamates (E 620–625) when used as food additives. Glutamate is absorbed in the intestine and it is presystemically metabolised in the gut wall. No adverse effects were observed in the available short-term, subchronic, chronic, reproductive and developmental studies. The only effect observed was increased kidney weight and increased spleen weight; however, the increase in organ weight was not accompanied by adverse histopathological findings and, therefore, the increase in organ weight was not considered as an adverse effect. The Panel considered that glutamic acid–glutamates (E 620–625) did not raise concern with regards to genotoxicity. From a neurodevelopmental toxicity study, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 3,200 mg monosodium glutamate/kg body weight (bw) per day could be identified. The Panel assessed the suitability of human data to be used for the derivation of a health-based guidance value. Although effects on humans were identified human data were not suitable due to the lack of dose–response data from which a dose without effect could be identified. Based on the NOAEL of 3,200 mg monosodium glutamate/kg bw per day from the neurodevelopmental toxicity study and applying the default uncertainty factor of 100, the Panel derived a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 30 mg/kg bw per day, expressed as glutamic acid, for glutamic acid and glutamates (E 620–625). The Panel noted that the exposure to glutamic acid and glutamates (E 620–625) exceeded not only the proposed ADI, but also doses associated with adverse effects in humans for some population groups.",

Candelilla wax (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of candelilla wax as a glazing agent acceptable. Candelilla wax is obtained from leaves of candelilla plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, resin esters, lactones, free wax resin alcohols, and free wax resin acids. The Panel considered that absorption of candelilla wax is expected to be low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the candelilla wax tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that candelilla wax is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on candelilla wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting candelilla wax. Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to candelilla wax, using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety. This allowed the Panel to conclude that the use of candelilla wax as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern.",

Carnauba wax (E 903) is authorised in the EU as food additive as glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) who allocated an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 7 mg/kg bw/day. The SCF did not establish an ADI but considered the use of carnauba wax as a glazing agent acceptable. Carnauba wax is a complex mixture of compounds consisting mainly of aliphatic esters (wax esters), α-hydroxyl esters and cinnamic aliphatic diesters obtained from the Brazilian Mart wax palm, Copernicia cerifera. The Panel considered that carnauba wax would be predicted to not be significantly absorbed from the diet and that if hydrolysed its main constituents could be absorbed and incorporated into normal cellular metabolic pathways. Based on the available data and the lack of structural alerts on carnauba wax it was concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity for carnauba wax. Subchronic and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies did not showed adverse effects related to carnauba wax intake. No chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies were available on carnauba wax. Overall, the Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on carnauba wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel considered that the exposure estimates to carnauba wax from the proposed uses resulted in sufficient margins of safety compared to the identified No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for carnauba wax, allowing the Panel to conclude that the use of carnauba wax as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern.",

Microcrystalline wax (E 905) is authorised quantum satis as a surface treatment agent on non-chocolate confectionery, chewing gum and decorations, coatings and fillings, except fruit based fillings. It is also permitted as a surface treatment of melons, papaya, mango and avocado. The substance was evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1990 and 1995 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1995. The JECFA established a group ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day for mineral oils, paraffins and microcrystalline waxes. The Panel noted that all mineral oil products accumulated in tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the exception of microcrystalline waxes. The Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity from microcrystalline wax (E 905). The Panel also considered that the available toxicity studies with mineral hydrocarbons, closely related from a chemical point of view with microcrystalline waxes, consistently reported no effects of concern associated with the intake of microcrystalline wax. The Panel further concluded that since no long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with microcrystalline wax E 905 were available, no ADI could be established. The Panel also concluded that the conservative exposure estimates to microcrystalline wax (E 905) from its use at maximum permitted level (following quantum satis rules), resulted in a sufficient margin of safety compared to the NOAEL established by the Panel for the closely related high viscosity mineral oils, and therefore the use microcrystalline wax (E 905) as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern.",

Montan acids are extracted from oxidised montan wax and esterified with ethylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol or triols, to form montan acid esters. Montan acid esters are authorised only for the surface treatment of fresh fruits. No data, specifically for montan acid esters, on toxicokinetics and reproductive and developmental toxicity were available. The available data on short-term and subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity were limited. Important deficiencies in the available studies on chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity were noticed. The data requested in the 1990s (i.e. chromosomal aberration in vitro, reproduction and teratogenicity studies, material characteristics, impurities, presence of PAHs) were not submitted. Furthermore no data were submitted following an EFSA public call for data in 2012. The Panel identified some summary data in the European Chemicals Agency database (ECHA) on registered substances that might have been relevant for the assessment of montan acid esters but the original study reports were not made available to EFSA. Based on these limitations in the toxicological database the Panel concluded that montan acid esters as a food additive could not be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "The EFSA ANS Panel delivered a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of oxidised polyethylene wax (OPEW) (E 914) as a food additive. E 914 is authorised at quantum satis only for the surface treatment of some fruits. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) evaluated the use of OPEW as a food additive but could not allocate an ADI and as an additive in food contact materials. The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) evaluated OPEW as a food contact material and established a TDI of 1 mg/kg bw/day. The ANS Panel considered that OPEW–an oxidised form of long-chain acids, alcohols and esters with a low epoxide and peroxide content–is stable in food matrices. Various 90-day studies in rats and a 90-day study in dogs reported no evidence of accumulation. In one rat study, at the highest dose, statistically significant increases in serum glucose and serum alkaline phosphatase and fatty livers were observed without other abnormalities. The lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered 800 mg/kg bw/day. OPEW is not genotoxic. Owing to the lack of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, the limitations of the reprotoxicity study and the unavailability of the key 90-day study, the Panel considered that the overall toxicity database was insufficient to derive an ADI. Mean intake estimates of OPEW ranged from 0.001-0.03 mg/kg bw/day and high intake estimates ranged from 0.03-0.18 mg/kg bw/day across all population groups. Considering the NOAEL of 800 mg/kg bw/day, the calculated margin of safety (MoS) at the highest intake level of 0.18 mg/kg bw/day was 4 400. The Panel concluded that the exposure estimates of E 914 from its use at the maximum reported use level resulted in a sufficient MoS and that, despite the limitations in the database, E 914 is of no safety concern at the maximum reported use level in its currently authorised use.",

Acesulfame K was re-evaluated by the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 2000 who confirmed an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 9 mg/kg body weight (bw). Acesulfame K is authorised in the EU for food use with exception for foods for young children. According to the applicant, the use of sweeteners is required to ensure palatable foods for the dietary management of patients whose compliance with the dietary regime (prescribed by healthcare professionals) is a key factor to their health. The exposure scenarios based on the proposed use by the applicant (4.1 or 5.9 mg acesulfame K/g protein) on the FSMPs and as specified in the mandate (9 mg acesulfame K/g protein, corresponding to 450 mg/kg (L)) indicated that if the daily protein intake (3 g protein/kg bw) is exclusively provided by the sweetened powdered product, the ADI would be exceeded. When the protein intake from the product is limited to either 10 or 20 g of protein/child at the concentration of 5.9 mg acesulfame K/g of protein, the ADI was exceeded in the 1 and 2 year age groups following consumption of 20 g protein/day. Considering the concentration of acesulfame K of 9 mg/kg day, only the 10 g protein scenario was below or close to the ADI. The ANS Panel concluded that the proposed extension of use of acesulfame K (E 950) at the level up to 9 mg/g protein while providing 10 g protein/day to 1- to 3- year-old children would not be of safety concern.",

In previous evaluations by JECFA and the SCF, an ADI of 40 mg/kg bw/day was established based on chronic toxicity in animals. Original reports, previous evaluations, additional literature and data made available following a public call were evaluated. Aspartame is rapidly and completely hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract to phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol. Chronic and developmental toxicities were relevant endpoints in the animal database. From chronic toxicity studies in animals, a NOAEL of 4000 mg/kg bw/day was identified. The possibility of developmental toxicity occurring at lower doses than 4000 mg/kg in animals could not be excluded. Based on MoA and weight-of-evidence analysis, the Panel concluded that developmental toxicity in animals was attributable to phenylalanine. Phenylalanine at high plasma levels is known to cause developmental toxicity in humans. The Panel concluded that human data on developmental toxicity were more appropriate for the risk assessment. Concentration-response modelling was used to determine the effects of aspartame administration on plasma phenylalanine using human data after phenylalanine administration to normal, PKU heterozygote or PKU homozygote individuals. In normal and PKU heterozygotes, aspartame intakes up to the ADI of 40 mg/kg bw/day, in addition to dietary phenylalanine, would not lead to peak plasma phenylalanine concentrations above the current clinical guideline for the prevention of adverse effects in fetuses. The Panel concluded that aspartame was not of safety concern at the current aspartame exposure estimates or at the ADI of 40 mg/kg bw/day. Therefore, there was no reason to revise the ADI of aspartame. Current exposures to aspartame - and its degradation product DKP - were below their respective ADIs. The ADI is not applicable to PKU patients.",

Sucralose is authorised in the EU for food use with exception for foods for young children. According to the applicant, the use of sweeteners is required to ensure palatable foods for the dietary management of patients whose compliance with the dietary regime (prescribed by healthcare professionals) is a key factor to their health. The exposure scenarios based on the proposed use by the applicant on the FSMP indicated that the total daily protein requirement (3 g protein/kg bw) could be covered by the product containing 400 mg sucralose/kg without exceeding the ADI. Also, exposure in other scenarios based on different assumptions was always below the ADI.

The safety of thaumatin as a food additive was previously evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1984 and 1988 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1989. Following these assessments, thaumatin was considered acceptable for use, and the ADI was established as ‘not specified’. In these evaluations it was, moreover, noted that thaumatin, being a protein, undergoes digestion to normal food components. In providing a scientific opinion on the safety of the proposed extensions of use and use levels, the ANS Panel has decided that a comparison of the exposure resulting from the current uses and use levels with the exposure resulting from these additional proposed uses would be sufficient to address the safety of thaumatin. The Panel calculated that a maximum daily intake of 1.03 mg/kg bw/day of thaumatin, resulting from the exposure assessment at the current proposed uses, or 1.10 mg/kg bw/day, at the proposed new Maximum Permitted Levels (MPLs), would represent 0.12 % or 0.13 %, respectively, of the total daily protein intake for an adult. These percentages would be even lower for children of all ages. The Panel concluded, based on the existing toxicological evaluations, that the proposed extension of uses and changes to use levels would result in a margin of safety of approximately 1 300 which would not represent a safety concern.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA carried out an exposure assessment of steviol glycosides (E 960) arising from their use as a food additive, taking into account the proposed extension of uses. In 2010, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the safety of steviol glycosides (E 960) and established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 4 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Conservative estimates of exposure, in both adults and children, suggested that it is likely that the ADI would be exceeded at the maximum proposed use level. In 2011, EFSA carried out a revised exposure assessment of steviol glycosides based on revised proposed uses and concluded that, even if the estimates were reduced, the high-level dietary exposure in children may still exceed the ADI. A request for extension of use in hot beverages has already been evaluated by EFSA in 2014. The current revised exposure estimates are based on the currently authorised uses, the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database and the proposed extension of use for tea beverages and instant coffee and instant cappuccino products up to 29 mg/L of steviol equivalents, rather than 10 mg/L, as assessed in the previous 2014 EFSA opinion. The Panel noted that, overall, the mean exposure estimates remain below the ADI of 4 mg/kg bw per day for all population groups, with the exception of toddlers (in one country) at the upper range of the high-level exposure estimates (95th percentile: 4.3 mg/kg bw per day), which remains above the ADI. The Panel concluded that dietary exposure to steviol glycosides (E 960) is similar to the exposure estimated in 2014 and therefore does not change the outcome of the safety assessment.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA carried out an exposure assessment of steviol glycosides (E 960) arising from their use as a food additive, taking into account the proposed extension of uses. In 2010, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the safety of steviol glycosides (E 960) and established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 4 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Conservative estimates of exposure, in both adults and children, suggested that it is likely that the ADI would be exceeded at the maximum proposed use level. In 2011, EFSA carried out a revised exposure assessment of steviol glycosides based on revised proposed uses and concluded that, even if the estimates were reduced, the high-level dietary exposure in children may still exceed the ADI. A request for extension of use in hot beverages has already been evaluated by EFSA in 2014. The current revised exposure estimates are based on the currently authorised uses, the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database and the proposed extension of use for tea beverages and instant coffee and instant cappuccino products up to 29 mg/L of steviol equivalents, rather than 10 mg/L, as assessed in the previous 2014 EFSA opinion. The Panel noted that, overall, the mean exposure estimates remain below the ADI of 4 mg/kg bw per day for all population groups, with the exception of toddlers (in one country) at the upper range of the high-level exposure estimates (95th percentile: 4.3 mg/kg bw per day), which remains above the ADI. The Panel concluded that dietary exposure to steviol glycosides (E 960) is similar to the exposure estimated in 2014 and therefore does not change the outcome of the safety assessment.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion on the safety of erythritol (E 968) in light of a paediatric study on the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of erythritol. In 1999, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) evaluated erythritol and assigned an ADI “not specified”. In 2003, the EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) concluded that erythritol is safe for use in foods. Erythritol is approved in the EU for the same uses as other polyols, but EU approval does not yet cover its use in beverages because the SCF opinion stated that the laxative threshold may be exceeded, especially by young consumers and through ingestion of erythritol in beverages. A paediatric study on the GI tolerability of erythritol was conducted with the goal to determine the maximum dose level of erythritol that is well-tolerated by young children aged 4-6 years old, in a single drinking occasion. The Panel noted that erythritol intake resulting from an incorporation rate of 2.5% in beverages (i.e. 0.59 g/kg bw) is below the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) for laxative effects (i.e. 0.71 g/kg/bw/day). The Panel noted that the margin of safety (MOS) between this NOAEL and the estimated daily intake of erythritol resulting from an incorporation rate of 2.5% in beverages (0.59 g/kg bw) is 1.24. The Panel concludes that this MOS is too low to ensure that children are adequately protected taking into account the fact that erythritol is also used in other food categories. The Panel concludes that there is a safety concern with respect to GI tolerability for the use of erythritol in beverages at a maximum use level of 2.5% for non-sweetening purposes.",
